n this lesson, you'll learn how to examine your local workspace in R and begin to explore the relationship between your workspace and the file system of your machine.

| Because different operating systems have different conventions with regards to things like file paths, the outputs of these commands may vary across machines.

| However it's important to note that R provides a common API (a common set of commands) for interacting with files, that way your code will work across different kinds of computers.

| Determine which directory your R session is using as its current working directory using getwd().

| Assign the value of the current working directory to a variable called "old.dir".

> old.dir <- wd
Error: object 'wd' not found

> old.dir <- list.files

| Try again. Getting it right on the first try is boring anyway! Or, type info() for more options.

| Type old.dir <- getwd() to assign the value of the current working directory to a variable called "old.dir".

> old.dir <- getwd()

| We will use old.dir at the end of this lesson to move back to the place that we started. A lot of query functions like getwd() have the useful property that they return the answer to the question as a
| result of the function.

| Use dir.create() to create a directory in the current working directory called "testdir".

> dir.create(testdir)
Error in dir.create(testdir) : object 'testdir' not found
> dir.create("testdir")

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

| It is often helpful to save the settings that you had before you began an analysis and then go back to them at the end. This trick is often used within functions; you save, say, the par() settings that
